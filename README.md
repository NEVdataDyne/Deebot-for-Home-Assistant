# Know working models:

- Deebot ozmo T8+
- Deebot ozmo T8
- Deebot ozmo T8 AIVI
- Deebot ozmo T5
- Deebot ozmo 960
- Deebot ozmo 950
- Deebot ozmo 920
- .. Possibly all models after 2019

### Other models:

- All non-ozmo devices may not work
- If your robot is working with Native Home Assistant integration that means it will not work with this custom component. please don't open an issue or ask for it.

## Description

With this Home Assistant Custom Component you'll be able to

- play/pause
- locate
- send to home
- clean[auto|map|area]
- track live map
- sensors
- and much more...

## Configuration

### Installation

To add your Ecovacs devices into your Home Assistant:

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz)
2. In HACS: Go to Integrations and search for -> Deebot for Home Assistant <- and install
3. Deebot for Home Assistant is now available in Home Assistant under Settings -> Integration -> Add -> Deebot for Home Assistant
4. Configure as described below

### Chinese server Configuration

For chinese server username you require "short id" and password. short id look like "EXXXXXX". DO NOT USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE NUMBER, it won't work.

country: cn
continent: as (or ww)

Since these servers are in china and unless you are close to china, don't expect very fast response.

### Country and Continent code

#### country:

Your two-letter country code (us, uk, etc).

#### continent:

Your two-letter continent code (as, na, eu, ww).

```
TW, MY, JP, SG, TH, HK, IN, KR -> AS
US -> NA
FR, ES, UK, NO, MX, DE, PT, CH, AT, IT, NL, SE, BE, DK -> EU
Any other country -> WW
```

For some countries, you will need to set continent to ww (meaning worldwide.) There is unfortunately no way to know the correct settings other than guessing and checking.

Additional note: There are some issues during the password encoding. Using some special characters (e.g., -) in your password does not work.

### Sensors

This integration expose a number of sensors
**All sensors are disabled by default.** You can enable only the required ones.

- sensor.ROBOTNAME_last_clean_image (A URL to the last success clean -- the image is on the ecovacs servers)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_brush (% main brush)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_heap (% Filter)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_sidebrush (% Side Brush)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_stats_area (Last or in cleaning Mq2 area)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_stats_time (Last or in cleaning Time)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_stats_type (Clean Type - Auto|Manual|Custom)
- sensor.ROBOTNAME_water_level (Current set water level, you can get fan speed by vacuum attributes)
- binary_sensor.ROBOTNAME_mop_attached (On/off is mop is attached)
- camera.ROBOTNAME_liveMap The live map

## UI examples

UI examples can be found in the [examples folder](docs/examples)

## Templates

Example for fan_speed:

```
{{ states.vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME.attributes['fan_speed'] }}
```

Get room numbers dynamically, very helpful if your robot is multi-floor or if your robot lose the map and you don't want to change automations every time:

```
{{ states.vacuum.YOURROBOTNAME.attributes.room_bathroom }}
```

## Example commands:

```yaml
# Clean all
service: vacuum.start
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
```

Relocate Robot (the little GPS icon in the APP)

```yaml
# Relocate Robot
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
data:
  command: relocate
```

You can clean certain area by specify it in rooms params, you can find room number under vacuum attributes

```yaml
# Clean Area
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
data:
  command: spot_area
  params:
    rooms: 10,14
    cleanings: 1
```

```yaml
# Customize Clean
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
data:
  command: custom_area
  params:
    coordinates: -1339,-1511,296,-2587
```

Use the app to send the vacuum to a custom area and afterwards search your logs for `{"type":"customArea","value":"x1,y1,x2,y2"}` entries to get the coordinates.

```yaml
# Set Water Level
# Possible amount values: low|medium|high|ultrahigh
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
data:
  command: set_water
  params:
    amount: ultrahigh
```

### Custom commands

It's also possible to send commands, which are not officially supported by this integration yet.
For that use also the `vacuum.send_command` service and you will get the response as `deebot_custom_command` event.

Example with the command `getAdvancedMode`

```yaml
service: vacuum.send_command
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
data:
  command: getAdvancedMode
```

When calling the above example you will get the event `deebot_custom_command` similar to:

```json
{
  "event_type": "deebot_custom_command",
  "data": {
    "name": "getAdvancedMode",
    "response": {
      "header": {
        "pri": 1,
        "tzm": 480,
        "ts": "1295442034442",
        "ver": "0.0.1",
        "fwVer": "1.8.2",
        "hwVer": "0.1.1"
      },
      "body": {
        "code": 0,
        "msg": "ok",
        "data": {
          "enable": 1
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "origin": "LOCAL",
  "time_fired": "2021-10-05T21:45:40.294958+00:00",
  "context": {
    "id": "[REMOVED]",
    "parent_id": null,
    "user_id": null
  }
}
```

The interesting part is normally inside `response->body->data`. In the example above it means I have enabled the advanced mode.

## Services

This integration adds the service `deebot.refresh`, which allows to manually refresh some parts of the vacuum.
In addition to the vacuum entity you must specify part you want to refresh.
An example call looks like:

```yaml
service: deebot.refresh
data:
  part: Status
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.YOUR_ROBOT_NAME
```

## Issues

If you have an issue with this component, please file a GitHub Issue and include y`ur Home Assistant logs in the report. To get full debug output from both the Ecovacs integration and the underlying deebotozmo library, place this in your configuration.yaml file:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.vacuum: debug
    custom_components.deebot: debug
    deebotozmo: debug
```
